The Aristotle Suites
1. [A form, a privation, and an underlying thing - eidos, sterēsis, hupokeimenon” ] (Form privation underlying thing-Tschofen-2022.mp4](https://github.com/drmoniquet/MoniqueTschofen/blob/main/Form%20privation%20underlying%20thing-Tschofen-2022.mp4)

4. Sketches: How can we train ourselves to see in new ways? 
To practice visual thinking, we sketched poses in 10, 30, and 60 second intervals.

- [Sketch two](https://github.com/drmoniquet/critical-making-dhsi23/blob/main/sketch2.jpeg) 
- [Sketch three](https://github.com/drmoniquet/critical-making-dhsi23/blob/main/sketch3.jpg)
2. [Grids & gestures](https://drmoniquet.github.io/critical-making-dhsi23/gridsandgestures.jpg): What are the material affordances of different media? How does a shape or grid constrain and organize thinking between the four corners of a page? 
In this assignment, we represented our day non-representationally, using a syntax of gutters and frames taking from comics. The challenge was to take advantage of the medium's affordances to represent passing time, space, and abstract emotional textures. 
3. Physical Hypertext: 
4. Twine
5. [Cut-up poetry](https://drmoniquet.github.io/critical-making-dhsi23/cutupPoem.jpeg): A return to Tristan Tzara's dada manifesto using children's scissors and old books. Our books, chosen at random from a used bookstore, included a paperback from the 1960s about women's sexuality, that was surprisingly liberal, and an economics textbook that had a peculiar obsession with cars. 
6. [Aristotleplants, a tracery bot](https://botsin.space/@aristotleplants): 
How can simple programming develop a permutational and combinatory syntax that emulates the thinking style of a writer?  
Two apps were used to generate this Mastodon bot - [tracery.io](https://tracery.io/) and [Cheapbotstootsuite](https://cheapbotstootsweet.com/). Aristotle's treatise on colours, which asks how we can observe colours and their blending using beautiful examples from nature, offers both the syntagmatic and paradigmatic content. 
7. Scalar: 
Ethical open sourced platforms for public scholarship: I built the foundations for a publication my undergrad students and I will put together: https://scalar.usc.edu/works/twentieth-century-literature-and-culture-/index 
8. P5 poetics: 
For this exercise, I made forks from Anastasia Salter's works, with minor adjustments to color and size. (I have to say I am delighted with how good this looks! Thanks Anastasia for sharing the
